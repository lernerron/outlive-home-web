    "content": "## The Challenge\n\nWhen we first visited this 1950s Coral Gables bungalow, the homeowner — a retired teacher in her late 70s — told us she loved everything about her home except the bathroom. The original tub was too high to step over safely. The tile floor was slippery. And there was nothing to hold onto.\n\nShe didn't want a bathroom that looked \"medical.\" She wanted something that matched the character of her home.\n\n## Our Approach\n\nWe started with a full assessment: measuring doorways, evaluating the existing plumbing, and understanding how she moves through the space. Then we designed a plan that addressed every safety concern while honoring the home's mid-century style.\n\n## What We Did\n\n### Barrier-Free Shower\nWe removed the old tub and installed a curbless, zero-threshold shower with a linear drain. The floor uses textured porcelain tile that provides grip without looking institutional.\n\n### Stylish Grab Bars\nWe installed brushed nickel grab bars that match the new fixtures. Positioned at the shower entry, along the back wall, and near the toilet, they blend in as part of the design.\n\n### Fold-Down Shower Seat\nA teak fold-down seat provides a secure place to sit while showering and folds flat against the wall when not in use.\n\n### Wider Doorway\nWe widened the bathroom doorway from 24\" to 34\" — enough for a walker or wheelchair if ever needed — and installed a pocket door to save space.\n\n### Non-Slip Flooring\nThe entire bathroom floor was replaced with slip-resistant porcelain tile in a warm gray tone that complements the home's original terrazzo.\n\n## The Result\n\nThe homeowner told us it was the first time in years she felt completely safe in her own bathroom. Her daughter said, \"It doesn't look like an accessible bathroom — it just looks like a beautiful bathroom.\" That's exactly the goal.\n\n## Every Home Is Different\n\nThis project took three weeks from first visit to final walkthrough. Every home and every person is different, which is why we start every project with a free, no-obligation assessment.\n\nWant to see what's possible for your home? [Get a free consultation](#).",

    "content": "## Why Grab Bars Matter\n\nFalls are the leading cause of injury for adults over 65, and the bathroom is where most of them happen. Grab bars are inexpensive, easy to install, and immediately effective. Here's where they go.\n\n## Shower and Tub\n\n- **Vertical bar at entry**: Install a 16–18\" vertical bar at the shower entrance, positioned at shoulder height. This gives you a secure grip when stepping over the tub ledge or threshold.\n- **Horizontal bar on the long wall**: A 24–36\" horizontal bar on the back wall of the shower, about 34–36\" from the floor, provides stability while standing.\n- **Angled bar near controls**: Place an angled bar near the faucet controls so you can steady yourself while adjusting water temperature.\n\n## Toilet Area\n\n- **Side-wall bar**: A 24\" horizontal bar on the wall next to the toilet, mounted 33–36\" from the floor, makes sitting and standing significantly easier.\n- **Swing-up bar** (optional): For users who need more support, a swing-up grab bar on the open side of the toilet provides bilateral stability.\n\n## General Bathroom\n\n- **Near the vanity**: A small vertical bar near the sink helps with balance during grooming.\n- **At the bathroom door**: A bar just inside the doorway prevents slips on wet tile.\n\n## Hallways and Stairways\n\nDon't stop at the bathroom. Continuous handrails on both sides of stairways and grab bars at key transition points throughout the home create a safety network.\n\n## Choosing the Right Grab Bar\n\n- **Material**: Stainless steel or chrome for wet areas. Decorative finishes are available to match your fixtures.\n- **Weight rating**: Always choose ADA-compliant bars rated for at least 250 lbs.\n- **Mounting**: Bars must be anchored into wall studs or with proper blocking. Suction-cup bars are not safe.\n\n## Professional Installation\n\nWhile grab bars seem simple, proper installation is critical. Incorrect mounting can give a false sense of security. Our team ensures every bar is anchored correctly and positioned at the right height for the people who will use it.\n\nReady to add grab bars to your home? [Contact us for a free consultation](#).",
